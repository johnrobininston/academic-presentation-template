# Academic Presentation Template (Quarto + Typst + Touying)

## Disclaimer + Thanks

This is a template based heavily on the wonderful work of **Kazuharu Yanagimoto** 
with their minimalistic presentation theme for Quarto + Typst + Touying, work which 
itself was deeply inspired by **Grant McDermottâ€™s** Clean theme for Quarto + Reveal.js.  
Both of their GitHub profiles and respective repositories are linked below.

## Information

This is the repository of the template I use for my adacemic presentations.  
Currently I have made only superficial formatting changes to the templates 
I used as my starting point to align more closely with my personal style preferences.  

## Installing

If you would like to use this template you may run the following command
 in your terminal:

```bash
quarto use template johnrobininston/academic-presentation-template
```

This will install the format extension and create an example qmd file
that you can use as a starting place for your document.

## Using

For detailed information on how to fully utilize this template please see the
documentation provided at: https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-clean-typst
